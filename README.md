# Separation of Business Logic:

    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Components: Reusable components for different parts of the application (Header, Footer).
        Feature Components: Components specific to each feature (ProductList, ProductDetail, CategoryList, CategoryDetail, etc.).
        Router: Define routes for different features and connect them to the appropriate components.
        Store (Vuex, Pinia): Manage state and business logic for products, categories, customers, and orders.

    Backend (Express.js):
        Controllers: Handle incoming requests, interact with services, and send responses.
        Models: Define the data structure for products, categories, customers, orders, etc.
        Services: Contain the business logic for each entity. Interact with models and perform CRUD operations.
        Routes: Define API routes for each entity, connecting them to the appropriate controller methods.
        Config: Store configuration files for the database connection, server settings, payment processors, and shipping providers.

# Design Pattern Choices:

    MVC (Model-View-Controller): Separates concerns into models, views (components in Vue), and controllers, facilitating code organization.
    RESTful API Design: Utilizes RESTful principles for designing API routes, making them predictable and scalable.
    Vuex/Pinia (State Management): Managing the state in the frontend, ensuring a centralized and predictable state management.
    Dependency Injection (Frontend): Components receive dependencies through props, promoting reusability and maintainability.
    Service Layer (Backend): Implements the business logic in service layers, keeping controllers clean and focused on handling HTTP requests.
